# Plugging-into-the-Future-An-Exploration-of-Electricity-Consumption-Patterns-Using-Tableau
Plugging into the Future analyzes electricity consumption across Indian states (2019–2020) using Tableau. It explores yearly and monthly trends, seasonal variations, and demand shifts through interactive dashboards, maps, filters, and a Tableau Story. The project is deployed via Flask, enabling web-based access and data-driven energy insights.
